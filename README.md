# Doprez.Stride.SteamAudio
Steam audio implementation in Stride.

Currently this only works with RAW audio files. I would like to get others working later as Raw files are massive.

## Setup
1. Reference the Doprez.Stride.SteamAudio library
2. add a raw asset file to the project (NOT an audio file - too many things were annoyingly internal)

3. create an emitter attached to an entity

5. done!
